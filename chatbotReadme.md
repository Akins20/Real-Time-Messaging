# Chatbot Project README

## Project Description

This project is a simple chatbot designed to assist customers with common problems or queries. It allows users to interact with the chatbot, which can provide information and guidance based on user input. Additionally, the chatbot can connect users to live agents for further assistance.

## Features

- Welcome message and user interaction.
- User registration check.
- Handling common problems and providing solutions.
- Simulated agent connection.
- Sending SMS alerts to agents when user assistance is needed.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have the following:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python libraries (requests) installed.
- Access to the Termii SMS API with a valid API key.
- Credentials for the website where the chatbot will be hosted (username and password).

## Getting Started

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd chatbot-project
   ```

3. Install the required Python libraries:

   ```
   pip install requests
   ```

4. Configure the project by updating the following variables in the `chat_with_customer` function:
   - `username`: Replace with your actual username for the website.
   - `password`: Replace with your actual password for the website.
   - `site`: Replace with the URL of the website where the chatbot will be hosted.
   - `api_key`: Replace with your actual Termii API key.

5. Run the project:

## Usage

- When the chatbot starts, it will greet the user and ask for their name.
- The chatbot will then ask if the user is a registered customer (Yes/No).
- Based on the response, the chatbot will provide assistance or connect to an agent.
- Users can select common problems (1, 2, 3) or describe their issue.
- Agents receive SMS alerts when assistance is required.
